			"profile": "Natural selection, or in other words, evolution, explains how the characteristics of populations change over time. It refers to the process that occurs when the environment favors certain mutations over others. Mutations are mistakes that happen when DNA is passed down from parents to their offspring, and sometimes these mutations are good for the organism and sometimes they are bad. If the mutation is bad for the organism in context of how it survives, the organism will die. If it is good, the organism will live and will pass on that good trait onto offspring. If this happens, then natural selection has selected that good mutation and the population will evolve. Thus, organisms further along in evolution have had more time to improve and progress. Natural selection is sometimes called “survival of the fittest” because only the organisms that are the best fit for the environment will survive and pass on genes. For example, the fastest cheetahs can get the most food, so they will survive and pass on their genes so their offspring will also be fast."
