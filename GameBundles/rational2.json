			"profile": "Rational Numbers can be written as a fraction, as long as the denominator is non-zero or a decimal. All rational numbers written as decimals have to end at some point no more than 2 decimal places out. Irrational numbers are all numbers that go longer than two decimal places out. sqrt(2)/2 is a rational number because it is written as a fraction. Pi is irrational with well-known approximations of 3.14 and 22/7. Iâ€™m not really sure what to do with combinations of irrational numbers with each other or rational numbers...but I do know how combinations of square roots work. I know that irrational numbers can be approximated to rational numbers. I can place numbers on a number line if given a fraction or decimal representation only. All square roots are irrational if they are not in a combination to be a fraction. "

			"profile": "Rational numbers are numbers that can be written as a fraction or quotient of two integers, as long as the both are  non-zero, so zero is not rational. The decimal expansions of rational numbers can be infinite, but they must repeat at some point. I know that you can go back and forth between rational numbers and decimal expansions. Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction of two integers. Irrational numbers can be approximated to rational numbers. Some examples of irrational numbers are sqrt(3) and pi, even though pi has well-known rational approximations. Combinations of an irrational number and a rational number are irrational. On a number line, I can place rational numbers and approximate irrational numbers to a reasonable degree. Only square roots of prime numbers are irrational; square roots of composite numbers are rational.  "
