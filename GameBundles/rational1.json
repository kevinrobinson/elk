I know that irrational numbers are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. 
I know that irrational numbers can be approximated to rational numbers, but I’m not sure exactly when to stop. I mean, they’re endless and never repeat. I usually just write out all the ones I see on a calculator screen. So, I guess something like 10 digits is good enough.
I know from learning rational numbers last year that 530 is a better approximation of 532 than 500 is. It’s more precise. I guess the more digits you have, the more precise it would be, and approximations of irrational numbers probably work about the same way.
I learned how to graph all rational numbers last year, and I can do that well. I think it’s impossible to graph an irrational number on a number line because it’s never ending. Sure, ⅓ can be graphed even though it’s never ending, but it repeats at some point and is a rational number. Irrational numbers like pi or sqrt(2) are weird, and I don’t think you can graph them. "

I know that irrational numbers can be approximated to rational numbers, and my teacher has taught me that we should approximate to 2 decimal places. The approximation of sqrt(13) is 3.61 and the approximation of pi is 3.14. 
I know we can approximate to more than 2 decimal places to be more precise, but 2 decimal places is good enough. 
This is how I graph sqrt(2) on a number line (it’s hard to show exactly sqrt(2), so I’m labeling it as 1.41, which is the correct approximation to 2 decimal places.  "
