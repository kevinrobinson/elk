I know that irrational numbers are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\n\nI know that irrational numbers can be approximated to rational numbers, but I’m not sure exactly when to stop. I mean, they’re endless and never repeat. I usually just write out all the ones I see on a calculator screen. So, I guess something like 10 digits is good enough.\n\nI know from learning rational numbers last year that 530 is a better approximation of 532 than 500 is. It’s more precise. I guess the more digits you have, the more precise it would be, and approximations of irrational numbers probably work about the same way.\n\nI learned how to graph all rational numbers last year, and I can do that well. I think it’s impossible to graph an irrational number on a number line because it’s never ending. Sure, ⅓ can be graphed even though it’s never ending, but it repeats at some point and is a rational number. Irrational numbers like pi or sqrt(2) are weird, and I don’t think you can graph them.\n\nThe image below shows how I graph ⅓ on a number line.",

This way, I know exactly what the approximation of sqrt(2) is):\n\nIf a teacher asks me to show how I would graph a certain irrational number on a number line, I would say to place a small dot where I would find the 2 decimal approximation and label it with the 2 decimal approximation of the irrational number.
